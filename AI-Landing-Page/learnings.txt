Some things that I have learned while doing this project-

, which to put after.
(2) I learned how to use divs properly, use flexbox to align content as needed.
(3) I learned how to style the webpage using css, how to write proper classes, 
on which classes to actually apply styles.
(4) Learned simple animations, transitions, and some new properties which I didnt know even existed.
(5) Learned how to make a website responsive using media queries.
(6) Learned how to make a parallex effect using javascript with the help of mousemove event listener.
(7) Learned how to display a signbox page with some animations and then close it.
(8) I learned about some tools such as boxicons which can be used for icons, I used this for my close icon, and clippy
which can be used to clip a element in your desired shape.
